- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...whatever peeks my intrest and there's 3d Printers,DjI,Codeing,Testing,Software,Buiulding Computers,Repairing and much much more. I grew up with parents that never told or showed me more to life. So I grew up (DUMB) and oblivious to a whole world. It always seemed like they wanted me to fail. I mean every question I ever asked was answered with a "IDK". I didn't know I could turn to others BC they had me in Mental Health @ the age of 5 they adopted me at 3yrs old. so I had Major Trust Issues and still do to an extent, its all good thought BC I am who I am BC of it and im a pretty good guy I think. You know it really pisses me off when I sit and think about it. Why? BC im 40 years old and i'm just finding out that I can do more. LOL, if that dont tell ya how dumb I am then im not sure if you understand ME.
